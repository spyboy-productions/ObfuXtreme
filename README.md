ObfuXtreme is a cutting-edge Python obfuscation tool designed to protect intellectual property by making reverse engineering extremely difficult. It combines multiple layers of security:

- **AES-256 Encryption** with CBC mode
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** manipulation
- **Anti-Debugging** techniques
- **Polymorphic Code Generation**
- **Zlib Compression** + **Marshal Serialization**

Perfect for protecting sensitive algorithms, API keys, and proprietary business logic.

### ‚ú® Feature 

| Feature | Found? | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Military-Grade Encryption** | ‚úÖ | Uses **AES-256-CBC** for encryption. |
| **AES-256-CBC with per-build random keys** | ‚úÖ | Generates a new **32-byte key** (`self.aes_key = os.urandom(32)`) and **16-byte IV** (`self.iv = os.urandom(16)`) per build. |
| **AST-Level Transformations** | ‚úÖ | Implements **Variable Renaming, Control Flow Flattening, and String Encryption** using `ast.NodeTransformer`. |
| **Variable Renaming** | ‚úÖ | Uses a hashing method (`shake_128`) to obfuscate variable names. |
| **Control Flow Flattening** | ‚úÖ | Implements state-based execution in `ControlFlowFlattener`. |
| **String Encryption** | ‚úÖ | Encrypts string literals with AES before execution. |
| **Anti-Analysis Protections** | ‚úÖ | Includes **Debugger Detection, Memory Bombardment, and Environment Checks**. |
| **Debugger Detection** | ‚úÖ | `_anti_debug()` exits if a debugger is detected (`sys.gettrace()` or `IsDebuggerPresent`). |
| **Memory Bombardment** | ‚ùå | No evidence of excessive memory usage or process exhaustion techniques. |
| **Environment Checks** | ‚úÖ | Uses OS-based debugger detection. |
| **Self-Destruct Mechanism** | ‚úÖ | Implements **Tamper detection with SHA-3 integrity checks** (used in `_decrypt_str` with exception handling). |
| **Stealth Operation** | ‚úÖ | Uses **silent failure modes** (returns empty string if decryption fails) and **exception handling**. |
| **Cross-Platform** | ‚úÖ | Designed for **Windows, Linux, and macOS** using standard Python and PyCryptodome. |

### ‚ùå Missing or Partially Implemented Features:
1. **Memory Bombardment** ‚Üí No aggressive memory-based anti-debugging measures.
2. **More Robust Self-Destruct** ‚Üí While `_anti_debug()` exits on detection, a **secure self-erasing mechanism** isn't implemented.

### ‚ùì Upcoming Feature:
**memory bombardment** and a more **secure self-destruct mechanism** would enhance protection.

## üìñ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spyboy-productions/ObfuXtreme.git
```
```
cd ObfuXtreme
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python ObfuXtreme.py <your_script.py>
```
`To Run Light version With No External requirements:`
```
python light_ObfuXtreme.py <your_script.py>
```
## üî• Usage

To obfuscate a Python script, run:

Example:

`python ObfuXtreme.py test.py`

This will generate an obfuscated file named obfuscated.py that contains the encrypted and protected version of your script.

üõ†Ô∏è Running the Obfuscated Script

Simply run:

`python obfuscated.py`

### To do:
1. add new module that Works only on the original machine.
2. add new module that ask for password.
3. add option to convert to .exe file after obfuscation.
